        "Description": "Generate a fast formula to determine the reporting hierarchy based on an assignment ID. If the assignment ID matches a predefined value, it is identified as a top-level manager, and both the person and assignment IDs are set to indicate this status. Otherwise, the formula assigns a specific manager's person and assignment IDs. This helps in structuring the compensation approval or reporting hierarchy. The formula returns the identified person and assignment IDs.",
